# Earthy Munchy 🌿

**The Pantry of the Earth - Botanical Apothecary**

Earthy Munchy is a premium e-commerce experience designed with a warm, botanical, and apothecary-inspired aesthetic. The project focuses on showcasing organic, earth-sourced products like wild honey, ancient millets, and premium spices through a luxurious and interactive user interface.

  - Parallax scrolling effects.
  - Hover-triggered 3D transforms for product jars.
  - Shimmer effects on ingredient cards.
  - Intersection Observer-based fade-in reveals.
- **Responsive Layout**: Fully responsive fluid design using modern CSS Grid and Flexbox.
- **No Heavy Dependencies**: Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. (Vite is included for development convenience).
